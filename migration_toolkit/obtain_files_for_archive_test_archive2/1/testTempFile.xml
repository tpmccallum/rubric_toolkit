		<abstract>A study was undertaken to investigate the relative efficacy and safety of the anthelmintic naphthalophos in sheep, either given alone or in combination with benzimidazole (fenbendazole and albendazole) or levamisole anthelmintics. Faecal nematode egg count reduction tests were carried out on 13 farms in central and southern New South Wales. Naphthalophos and combinations of naphthalophos with levamisole and fenbendazole were included in the drench tests. Safety trials were carried out on eight farms where approximately 50 000 sheep were treated with naphthalophos and albendazole mixture. The mortality rate in safety trials was 0.05%, with most fatalities occurring on one farm.  The mixtures were more effective than naphthalophos alone.  A combination of naphthalophos and fenbendazole was more effective than a combination of naphthalophos and levamisole, and will provide a sufficiently safe drench rotation option (A).</abstract>
