objective 1. To provide accurate estimates of factors affecting costs and
 returns from producing milk.
; 2. To use estimates of costs and returns to project the effects of changes in
 manufacturing milk prices on farm production and incomes.
; 3. To incorporate results from analysis into a spreadsheet model of the
 supply of milk in Australia for use by the industry in simulating responses to
 changes in economic conditions.
methodology Using data collected from BAE4, the factors affecting the costs and
 returns from dairy farming will be estimated.  Using a technique designed to
 estimate the unit costs and net returns from milk production a supply response
 relationship can be identified.  The relationship will then be used to predict
 changes in farm production that would result from changing milk prices.

objective 1. To undertake a market analysis of the world white sugar trade.
; 2. To assess the potential for the Australian sugar industry.
; 3. To become a white sugar exporter.
methodology It is proposed to examine the growth in world trade in white sugar
 over the last decade so as to analyse whether this growth has stabilised or is
 likely to increase further. To do this, trade will be examined on a regional
 basis and regression analysis will be undertaken to estimate the main
 determinants of demand for white or refined sugar in the key markets. Such an
 analysis will enable projections to be made about future levels of demand in
 these countries.
progress A trade database is being developed, and world white and raw sugar
 price series (on a monthly basis) have been collated.

objective 1. To evaluate the likely extend of movements between broadacre farm
 enterprises during times of rapidly changing relative prices, and to assess
 whether the current downturn in the wool and wheat industries could bring on a
 repeat of the beef industry 'crash' of the 1970's.
; 2. To provide information to the meat industry on the likely impact of
 changes in commodity prices on the size and distribution of beef and sheep
 farms.
; 3. To estimate the likely changes in farm incomes associated with the
 expansion or contraction of enterprises resulting from the major realignment
 in prices received for beef relative to those for wheat and wool.
methodology 1.  The project will rely on the availability of data collected as
 part of the Australian agricultural and grazing industry survey which is
 comprised of 1060 farms. 2.  Relationships between costs and returns in
 broadacre industries will be estimated using the latest analytical techniques.
 3. Historical data will be used to estimate those factors which influence
 costs and returns at the farm level. This information will be used to estimate
 likely changes in the range and size of broadacre farm enterprises from
 changes in commodity prices. 4.  Empirical analysis of cross commodity supply
 relationships between beef, wool and grains when there are major changes in
 prices received from one of these commodities will also be undertaken.

objective 1. To provide the MRC and, through it, Australian meat producers with
 a comprehensive set of physical and financial data at national, state,
 industry and regional levels.
; 2. To monitor the economic performance of the beef and sheep meat industries
 by conducting a survey of over 1400 farms using advanced survey and
 statistical methods.
; 3. To project the likely economic situation of meat producers and provide
 time series and cross sectional data for use by researchers, industry and
 policy makers.
; 3. To improve decision making and policy development for the livestock
 industries by providing data for analyses of the physical and financial
 performance of farms.
; 5. To set up an industry surveys steering group to assist industry
 representatives to become more aware of the data available and to provide an
 opportunity for them to obtain data on current issues as a basis for research
 and policy formation which will maximise the benefit to industry.
methodology The research plan for the Australian agricultural and grazing
 industries survey (AAGIS) involves the following 7 stages: 1. Coordinating an
 ABARE/livestock industries survey steering group. This group will provide a
 forum for discussing survey issues with relevant industry representatives and
 provide the opportunity for commissioning supplementary data collections to
 address topical issues which can be analysed using the physical and financial
 data from AAGIS. 2. Designing the main and supplementary questionnaires and
 data handling system which incorporates the facility for industry to add extra
 questions on issues relevant at the time of the survey. 3. Designing the
 sample using the latest statistical techniques and the agricultural census as
 the framework. 4. Field and followup telephone interviews using experienced
 field officers to collect information from over 1400 farms nationally as well
 as from their accountants and produce outlets. 5. Processing data using a
 fully integrated system of data entry, editing and output using an INGRES
 database. 6. Releasing results from the survey through ABARE publications, the
 national Outlook Conference in February, regional outlook conferences, ASPIRE
 (electronic time series of survey data) and individual data request. 7.
 Developing a special report showing detailed results for the livestock
 industries, in consultation with industry representatives as part of the role
 of the surveys steering group.

 (BAE26) (1992/93)
objective To analyse and review the institutional arrangements in the eastern
 European wool textile industry, paying particular attention to: - how they are
 likely to affect imports of Australian wool - the impact on Australian growers
 - providing information to the Australian Wool Corporation and the government
 on appropriate strategies for marketing wool in the region.
methodology Analysis of the changing institutional arrangements and the
 decision making processes under the emerging market system will be the focus
 of the study. The report reviews the economic and institutional reforms taking
 place in eastern Europe and assesses the implication of these for changes for
 the wool textile industry. Projections of wool production, domestic
 consumption, textile production and trade in wool and wool textiles are
 discussed.  The implication of these changes for the Australian wool industry
 are also assessed.
progress In July 1991, two ABARE officers visited Europe to collect data and
 information required for the completion of the project.  Based on the findings
 of this trip, a draft internal ABARE report was provided to the WRDC on a
 draft-in-confidence basis in September 1991.

objective To provide annual projections of supply and demand of the principal
 wine grape varieties being grown in the principal producing regions for the
 three vintages of 1994, 1995 and 1996. This information will assist growers in
 their annual plantings/grubbing decisions and allow wine makers to plan future
 vintages with more certainty about likely grape supply.
methodology For the supply projections, an updated data set of variables that
 will affect future grape supply will be established. This will include annual
 series of bearing and non-bearing areas of vines and grubbings and grape
 production by variety and regions for the period 1982-83 to 1991-92. Data
 collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for their Viticulture
 Australia publication will be supplemented by information gathered by ABARE
 officers from state departments of agriculture, nurseries and vine improvement
 societies and a survey of the larger wineries as appropriate. Where possible,
 information gathered from these sources will be presented in tabular form.
 From this data set, plantings and average yields will be estimated. An
 economic model will then be used to project bearing area and and hence grape
 supply for the following three seasons.  Point forecasts will be provided for
 grape supplies by region and variety using projected yields. Sensitivity
 analysis will also be used to show the influence of poor and good seasonal
 conditions on supplies of grapes. For the demand projections, a mail census of
 all major wineries will be undertaken in the first quarter of 1993 with
 follow-up visits to the larger wineries.  One visit of two days to the Hunter
 Valley and one visit of ten days to wineries in New South Wales, South
 Australia and Victoria are planned. During the course of these visits,
 researchers will also take the opportunity to obtain details of any vine
 planting programs undertaken by the major wineries.  They will also make
 contact with State Department of Agriculture officers who are involved with
 viticulture in these grape growing districts. There are approximately 600
 wineries in Australia.  However, it is not inteded to survey all of these
 wineries.  In 1991, the Winemakers Federation of Australia supplied ABARE with
 list of 34 wineries which it considered would purchase the major proportion of
 all wine grapes. In view of possible ownership changes over the next 12 months
 and in light of the response from wineries in the 1991 study, the Federation
 will again be asked to provide an updated list of major wineries and
 appropriate contacts.
progress In November 1993, ABARE published Research Report 93.16, titled '
 Winegrapes, Projections of Wine Grape Production and Winery Intake to
 1995-96'. The report provides information on expected trends in production and
 intake of the principal wine grape varieties for the industry to use when
 making decisions on planting, grubbings and intake.
