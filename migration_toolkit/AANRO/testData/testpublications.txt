abstract A study was undertaken to investigate the relative efficacy and safety
 of the anthelmintic naphthalophos in sheep, either given alone or in
 combination with benzimidazole (fenbendazole and albendazole) or levamisole
 anthelmintics. Faecal nematode egg count reduction tests were carried out on
 13 farms in central and southern New South Wales. Naphthalophos and
 combinations of naphthalophos with levamisole and fenbendazole were included
 in the drench tests. Safety trials were carried out on eight farms where
 approximately 50 000 sheep were treated with naphthalophos and albendazole
 mixture. The mortality rate in safety trials was 0.05%, with most fatalities
 occurring on one farm.  The mixtures were more effective than naphthalophos
 alone.  A combination of naphthalophos and fenbendazole was more effective
 than a combination of naphthalophos and levamisole, and will provide a
 sufficiently safe drench rotation option (A).

abstract A study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of a
 formulation containing moxidectin and six in one vaccine in sheep for
 immunization against clostridial diseases and caseous lymphadenitis. Field
 trials were conducted with vaccines formulated with traditional six in one
 clostridial/corynebacterial antigens with and without moxidectin, using 205
 crossbred Merino lambs on a farm in central western New South Wales. Effective
 control of nematodes and responses to antigens were achieved following
 subcutaneous administration. Occasional minor tissue reactions were observed,
 but there were no other adverse effects, and the formulation proved safe and
 efficacious under field conditions (A).

abstract A study was undertaken to examine whether growth of kids after weaning
 and internal parasitism were affected by grazing on pasture or fodder crop and
 by an initial treatment of ivermectin at weaning. Experiments were conducted
 at Cressy Tas on 21 Angora and 94 Cashmere kids, grazing forage rape,
 uncontaminated pastures, or pastures contaminated with nematodes, and treated
 with ivermectin anthelmintic at weaning or not treated.  The results
 demonstrated the benefit to weaner goats of grazing a fodder crop of rape
 compared with pasture treatments. Grazing a crop of high nutritional value
 maintained a weight advantage and there were no production losses due to
 nematode infection.  It was shown that careful grazing management and
 strategic use of anthelmintics reduces the reliance on and the cost of
 anthelmintics and probably decreases selection pressure on parasites for
 anthelmintic resistance while increasing rates of growth for weaner goats.

abstract The assessment of toxicity of agricultural chemicals is discussed and
 whether chemical residues are associated with any risk to consumers of
 agricultural products.  An examination of the public perception of risk shows
 that the risk associated with pesticide use is perceived to be very high.
 However, the normal diet contains a large number of naturally occurring
 pesticides that are produced by plants to defend themselves, and many of these
 natural pesticides have been shown to be carcinogenic in rodents at high
 doses. Requirements for testing of the safety of pesticides are rigorous, and
 the maximum residue limit (MRL) of a compound in food is calculated so that
 the acceptable daily intake will not be exceeded by the sum of the residues
 derived from all sources in the human diet. However, the MRL may occasionally
 be exceeded without risk, since it does not represent a level that equates to
 a health hazard.

 details of its description, history, distribution, habitat, growth and
 development, reproduction, population dynamics, importance, relevant
 legislation, and weed management.  Dense thickets of broom prevent
 establishment of native vegetation and impede access, particularly to
 watercourses.  Thickets also harbour pest animals such as feral pigs and other
 invasive animals such as blackbirds.  Broom is declared a noxious weed
 throughout South Australia and in parts of New South Wales, Victoria and
 Tasmania.

abstract A study was undertaken to assess the potential of Australian Scelio
 species as parasites of acridid grasshoppers for inclusion in a United States
 grasshopper integrated pest management project. Surveys of Scelio spp.,
 parasites of acridid eggs, were conducted in 1990-94 at a range of sampling
 sites in New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia.  Parasitism
 of economically important grasshopper and locust species was frequently
 substantial, confirming an important, albeit often localized, role by Scelio
 spp. in regulating host populations. Scelio spp. were stenophageous, and
 although some species parasitized several hosts, typically a principal host
 was readily identifiable. New hosts, and significant new geographical
 distributions, were recorded for several Scelio species (A).

abstract Factors that influence bait uptake by feral pigs (Sus scrofa) will
 determine the efficacy of poisoning and trapping programs for the control of
 pigs and have the potential to introduce bias to indices of pig abundance.  A
 study was undertaken to investigate the influence of pasture availability on
 uptake of bait trails consisting of soaked wheat, by pigs at six sites along
 the Paroo River NSW.  The results showed that increasing pasture biomass
 significantly reduced the density of pigs corresponding to a given percentage
 uptake of trail baits, suggesting that, as pasture biomass increased, fewer
 pigs consumed trail baits and/or the number of bait trails each pig consumed
 declined.  Assuming the former, the effect of increasing pasture biomass on
 the relationship between percentage uptake of bait trails and pig density
 indicated that, for every increase in pasture biomass of 100 kg/ha, the
 percentage of pigs consuming bait declined by about 10% (A).

abstract Plasma concentrations of growth hormone (GH) are elevated in sheep
 during undernutrition.  A study was undertaken to determine whether this
 increased secretion mediated nutritional effects on reproduction or wool
 growth, using ewes immunized against growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH)
 and given a low quality, sub- maintenance diet.  It was found that
 immunization reduced plasma concentrations of GH at all times measured,
 through reduced pulse frequency, reduced pulse amplitude and reduced baseline
 concentrations. Rates of liveweight loss, plasma concentrations of LH and FSH,
 and wool growth were similar in immunized and control sheep.  Numbers of
 ovarian follicles and corpora lutea were also unaffected by immunization.  It
 was concluded that high endogenous concentrations of GH in sheep given food
 below maintenance are necessary to maintain plasma insulin-like growth factor
 1 (IGF-1), but do not affect the concentration of gonadotropins or ovarian
 follicular growth (A).

abstract The role of growth hormone (GH) in normal growth is well established,
 but its role during recovery after liveweight loss in adult sheep is less
 defined. A study was undertaken to examine the interaction of endogenous GH
 with energy or protein supplements during feeding of ewes in low body
 condition. Control ewes and ewes immunized against growth hormone releasing
 hormone (GHRH) were given food below maintenance for 107 days, then
 supplemented with either fish meal or barley for 28 days, then grazed on
 abundant pasture. Immunization reduced plasma concentrations of GH, insulin,
 insulin- like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and prolactin.  When grazed at pasture
 immunized ewes gained liveweight more slowly, grew less wool, and had poorer
 carcass condition.  It was concluded that during liveweight regain, endogenous
 GH initially affected fat deposition, which in turn affected feed intake and
 wool growth (A).

abstract A study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that single space
 feeders (SSFs) should reduce aggression between piglets while they are feeding
 and might allow them to eat more food.  The importance of aggression was
 studied in 210 piglets weaned at 30 days, by either weaning piglets as
 littermates or mixing them into new social groups. The use of a 'wet and dry'
 SSF did not enhance growth rate or voluntary feed intake in the 28 days after
 weaning. Piglets mixed together from different litters at weaning grew
 proportionately 0.34 faster in the first 14 days after weaning than piglets
 weaned as littermates.  It was concluded that SSFs failed to increase the
 production of weaner piglets, whilst mixing non-littermate piglets into a new
 social group seemingly enhanced performance from weaning to 56 days of age (A).

abstract A study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that maintenance of
 voluntary feed intake of piglets after weaning would prevent the normal
 decline in villous height and increase in crypt depth and hence preserve the
 structure and function of the small intestine. In experiments using 32 piglets
 in groups, feeding ewes' milk or ewes' milk plus 20 g L-glutamine/L maintained
 villous height and crypt depth compared with piglets killed at weaning.  In
 contrast, piglets given a dry starter diet had shorter villi, deeper crypts,
 and proportionately 0.21 to 0.28 less protein in their intestinal mucosa.  The
 results showed that the structure and function of the small intestine can be
 preserved when a milk diet is given after weaning, and suggest an association
 between feed intake and villous height in determining post weaning weight gain
 (A).
