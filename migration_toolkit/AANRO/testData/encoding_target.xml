The impact of weeds in the arid zone is reviewed with emphasis on both the economic loss to pastoralism and the alteration of ecosystem structure and function.  Conservation of the native pastoral vegetation is most important and preventing introduction or early control of primary infestations is most important, as, once a weed is naturalized in the arid zone, a land manager has little scope to minimize the impact of the weed. Hopbush, innocent weed, mesquite, pepper tree, prickly acacia, prickly pear, punty and turpentine are most likely to spread and have significant impact to agriculture and the environment. The potential impact of African boxthorn, Calomba daisy, galvanized burr, onion weed, tamarisk and Ward&#xED;s weed on agriculture and the environment or the arid zone is unknown.  Extension, rather than regulation, is proving to be most successful at achieving aims of coordinating control programs (A).</abstract><keywords>Weeds|Invasion|Losses|Conservation|Ecosystems|Arid zones|Weed control|Vegetation|Extension|Native species</keywords></record>
