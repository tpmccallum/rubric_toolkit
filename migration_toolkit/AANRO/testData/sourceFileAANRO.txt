abstract Duckweed species (Lemnaceae) have demonstrated, in overseas
 experiments, a tremendous ability to remove mineral contaminants, primarily
 nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, sodium and magnesium, from
 wastewaters emanating from municipal sewage treatment works, intensive animal
 production industries and food processing factories. The research program
 aimed to adapt overseas studies to Australian conditions using Spirodila
 species of duckweed. The results were impressive and confirmed that duckweed
 has the capability to further polish municipal wastewater in Australia. Trials
 of duckweed on coal mine wastewater showed that the plant can tolerate the
 wastewater, but cannot uptake the huge quantities of salts required by the
 mining companies.
