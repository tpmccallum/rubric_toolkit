<b>Abstract:</b>
<P>
In this paper we investigate the recession dynamics of male and female full-time and part-time employment in Australia. The research is motivated by segmented labour market models that capture ‘secondary’ jobs as the first option for employment adjustment available to firms facing a recession. Primary jobs are seen as being ‘hours-adjusting’ rather than ‘persons-adjusting’. A simple model of full-time job creation and destruction is sketched that generates counter-cyclical reallocations, while pro-cyclical reallocation is generated for part-time jobs. The share of full-time (part-time) job destruction in total full-time (part-time) job reallocation is counter-cyclical  <P>  We construct measures of job creation and destruction from data on job findings and separations, to explore the dynamics of the model further. Graphical and econometric analysis of labour force stock and gross flows data for Australian since 1978 reveals that full-time male employment bears the burden of adjustment in recessions. Part-time employment continues to grow as economic activity plummets. These findings contradict the intuition of segmented labour market models.  <P>  Markov-switching (vector) autoregressive (MS-VAR) models are estimated to develop congruent models of male and female employment growth over the cycle allowing for shifts in regimes to explore the cyclical dynamics more fully. The estimation results confirm that male full-time employment takes the brunt of adjustment in the downturn in Australia and is strongly asymmetric. Part-time employment does not appear to exhibit asymmetries.   <P>
